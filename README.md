## Overviews

This project is a demo implementation of **sentry-unity**, the Sentry SDK for Unity Crash Reporting. The demo produces several crashes that get captured by sentry-unity and sent to Sentry.io. You can also download the SDK manually here https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity as a distribution zip.

The **Official Sentry Documentation** for Unity is at https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unity/
